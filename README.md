# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

In here, we will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. You will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also a service worker is added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Getting Satrted

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
